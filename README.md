# Coding Quiz | 04 Weekly Challenge

## Description

This application is used to test coding knowledge of users. When the user firsts visits the page they are shown a screen which explains how the quiz functions, and informs the user that wrong answers will penalize the user.

Once the user clicks the start button the timer begins to count down. If the user selects the correct answer then "Correct" reflects below the choices, and then the next question appears. If they select the incorrect answer then "Incorrect!" appears below the choices and 10 seconds is deducted from the remaining time.

The faster the quiz is completed the higher the score. Once all questions have been answered, or the timer hits zero, the user is directed to a page which allows them to enter their intials. Upon submission of this page, the user is then directed to the Highscores, where they can view their previous attempts.
